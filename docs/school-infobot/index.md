# School Infobot

A school infobot is a battery powered robot that wonders
the halls of a school answering questions for students
such as "Are there any coding clubs in this school?".
They are built using the following components:

1. RC car chassis (about $120)
2. Raspberry Pi 5 with AI Hat, Microphone and Speaker
3. Screen and Microphone
4. Wireless connection to a school-GPU running [Ollama](../glossary.md#ollama) and a chatbot

Note that the School Infobot is not designed to answer general questions, only
questions about the school.  The content is typically taken
from the schools website with additional data in the
history of the school, staff and current calendar all
pulled from the school's website.
